Project Name:	
```
 	Online Voting System
```
Description:
```
 	This application will allow users to create small groups from which they may conduct polls. Users will need to create an account by supplying an unique e-mail address, unique username,
 and a password to the account creation form. Afterwards, an e-mail containing a link with a verification code (a 32-character alphanumeric string) as a parameter will be sent to the user. When
clicked, the user's account will be generated. Afterwards, the user may log in. Logging in confers new options to the user, including the ability to create groups. Groups can contain users as
members and are invited by the creator of the group. Group ownership may be transferred to other members, as well. Group creators may also delete groups and add polls. Polls have at least two vote types,
but may theoretically contain many more. Open polls can be voted on by members of the group.
